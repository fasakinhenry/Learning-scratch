## Course Format

The course consists of 5 modules (also called weeks or units), where we will be looking at different computing topics, as described in the Course Syllabus. The main components of the course are:

- **Video Lectures:** There will be around 1 hour of lecture each week, delivered as short videos supported by slides and code examples. In-video quizzes will help you check that you have correctly understood new concepts – these are optional and do not count towards your final grade. Feature videos of interviews with computer scientists and non-computer scientists reflecting on each week’s topics are also included.

- **Weekly Quizzes:** There are 5 weekly quizzes, one for each week. These will contain multiple choice questions, which may require that you write, test or analyze short programs.

- **Peer-Assessed Projects:** There will be 2 programming projects, which will be assessed by your classmates. These are meant to equip you with hands-on programming experience.

- **Discussion Forums:** You are strongly encouraged to participate in the discussion forums to interact with your classmates and learn from each other. There you can post any questions, comments, or even whacky ideas that you have related to this course. Here you can find a handbook of good practice for the use of the discussion forums.

## Grading

The final grade for the course will be calculated based on your performance in the weekly quizzes and the peer-assessed projects.

- There will be 5 weekly quizzes. Each weekly quiz will contain 10 multiple choice questions, contributing towards 10% of your final grade. Each quiz can be submitted at most 5 times within a 24-hour period, and you will be awarded the highest grade of all your submissions.

- There will be 2 peer-assessed projects. Each of these will involve creating and uploading a program in Scratch, as well as evaluating at least 3 projects of other students. You will be provided with a detailed marking scheme for this. The first project contributes towards 20% of your final grade, while the second contributes towards 30% of your final grade. The final grade for each project will be calculated based on the assessments of your fellow students.

- In order to pass the course, you will need to obtain at least 50% in each quiz and in each peer-assessed project.
