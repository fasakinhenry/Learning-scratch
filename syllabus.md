# Syllabus

**Unit 1: Your First Computer Program**
In this unit, you’ll create your very first computer program! You’ll be introduced to basic programming concepts and you’ll familiarise yourself with Scratch.

- Algorithms.

- Sequence.

- Selection: if-then.

- Iteration: infinite loops.

- Incremental development of programs.

- Simple software testing.

-Scratch: interface, motion palette, looks palette, coordinates.


**Unit 2: Code Gone Loopy!**

In this unit, you’ll keep working with control structures, find out how to use events in your programs, and incorporate visual and sound effects in Scratch. You’ll also start thinking about your program's requirements and design.

- Iteration: count-controlled loops, decision-controlled loops.

- Selection: if-then-else.

- Event-driven programming.

- Computational thinking: abstraction, decomposition.

- Software engineering: requirements, design.

- Scratch: control palette, events palette, pen palette, sound palette, sensing palette.


**Unit 3: Remixing Games**

In this unit, you’ll have a go at modifying and extending existing games to create new versions. You’ll also learn about software engineering practices for testing and documenting your programs.

- Variables.

- Complex conditions.

- Nested loops.

- Software engineering: documentation, testing, maintenance.

- User interaction.

- Scratch: data palette, operators palette, comments, paint editor, remixing.


**Unit 4: Reusing Your Code**

In this unit, you’ll be introduced to procedures and cloning in Scratch, and you’ll apply these ideas to reuse your code.

- Procedures.

- Good software properties: modularity, flexibility.

- Computational thinking: generalization.

- Scratch: more blocks palette, clones, backpack.


**Unit 5: Think Like a Software Engineer**

In this unit, you’ll follow all the steps of software development to create a fun computer game. You’ll also learn about message broadcasting and concurrency.

- Software development process.

- Software development approaches: waterfall model, iterative and incremental, prototyping.

- Coordination: concurrency, message broadcasting.

- Computational complexity.

- Other programming languages.

- Scratch: message broadcasting, publishing projects.
